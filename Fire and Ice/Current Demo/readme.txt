Controls
Press R to Restart the game. 
Right Arrow Key makes the charcter go right. 
Left Arrow Key makes the charcter go left. 
Up Arrow Key makes the charcter jump.
The longer up press it the further he goes(to a point).
The Down Arrow Key makes the charcter crouch.

Arrows Keys Control the menu(up and down)
Use the 'X' Key to select your option.
Saving is not in this version as you see the load game option is greyed out.
Nothing should happen if you select it.
 
WASD can be used to control the charcter also but I would not recommend that.
There is no music yet. So don't worry about sound!
Please give me your feedback and any bugs that you see!
