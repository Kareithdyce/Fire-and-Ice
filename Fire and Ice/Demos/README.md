Controls
Right Arrow Key makes the character go right. 
Left Arrow Key makes the character go left. 
Up Arrow Key makes the charcter jump.
The longer the up press the further he goes (to a point).
The Down Arrow Key makes the charcter crouch.

Arrows Keys Control the menu(up and down)
Use the 'X' Key to select your option.

WASD can be used to control the character also but I would not recommend that.
Please give me your feedback and any bugs that you see!
